<h1> School Projects </h1>
<h2> CS 401: Introduction to Web Development - FraudCoin</h2>
<p>
    For my CS 401 class I created a website called "FraudCoin" that was a mock cryptocurrency website.
    The website was created using HTML, CSS, PHP, JQuery/JavaScript, and SQL. The website allowed users to create accounts, login, and
    purchase and sell the cryptocurrency. The website also had a leaderboard that showed the top users with the
    most currency or coins with the greatest value. The GitHub repository with a more detailed description can be found 
    <a href="https://github.com/PaulEllis2001/CS401-Website">here</a>. Please reach out if you wish to see the hosted website in action.

<h2> CS 221: Computer Science II - Double Linked List</h2>
<p>
    For my CS 221 class I created an indexed unsorted double linked list data structure in Java that could be used to store any type of data. As part of this project
    I created a comprehensive test suite to test the functionality of the data structure. The GitHub repository with a more detailed description can be found
    <a href="https://github.com/PaulEllis2001/UnsortedDLL">here</a>.

<h2>Senior Design Project: Totalled</h2>
<p>
    For my senior design project I worked with a team of 3 other students to create an application for the Boise State University Biomechanichal Engineering Department,
    the goal of the project was to create invoices and individual team expense breakdowns from the annual expense report. This application reduced the time spent on this
    task from days to seconds. The application was created using Kotlin, the Compose Multiplatform GUI, Apache POI for Excel sheet manipulation, and JUnit for testing.
    My role in the project was to parse the Excel sheets to extract the team purchases. The GitHub repository with a more detailed description can be found

<p>
    This website is another project of mine that I have written in PHP, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I have hosted this on a personal server
    that I am managing and own.
