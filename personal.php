<h2> CS 401: Introduction to Web Development - FraudCoin</h2>
<p>
    For my CS 401 class I created a website called "FraudCoin" that was a mock cryptocurrency website.
    The website was created using HTML, CSS, PHP, JQuery/JavaScript, and SQL. The website allowed users to create accounts, login, and
    purchase and sell the cryptocurrency. The website also had a leaderboard that showed the top users with the
    most currency or coins with the greatest value. The GitHub repository with a more detailed description can be found 
    <a href="https://github.com/PaulEllis2001/CS401-Website">here</a>. Please reach out if you wish to see the hosted website in action.

<h2> CS 221: Computer Science II - Double Linked List</h2>
<p>
    For my CS 221 class I created an indexed unsorted double linked list data structure in Java that could be used to store any type of data. As part of this project
    I created a comprehensive test suite to test the functionality of the data structure. The GitHub repository with a more detailed description can be found
    <a href="https://github.com/PaulEllis2001/UnsortedDLL">here</a>.
