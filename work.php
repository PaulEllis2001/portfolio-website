<h1>Work Experience</h1>
<h2>Amazon</h2>
<p> 
    During the summer of 2022 I worked as a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon. 
    For my internship I was given a project to research, design, implement, and document.
    The project was a configuration management system that would allow for the easy creation and management
    of configurations for internal customers. This entailed use of AWS Lambda, CDK, VPC, and Route53 for the backend
    and Java Server Pages for the front end website portion. The tool was designed to take the information from a form
    on the front end, format it, calculate the difference between the existing configuration, and then apply the changes
    to a version controlled file and start a pull request to update the configuration.

<h2>Residence Inn Boise Downtown/City Center</h2>
<p>
    I worked as a front desk agent at the Residence Inn Boise Downtown/City Center from August 2020 to October 2021.
    My responsibilities included checking guests in and out, answering phone calls, making reservations, and
    providing excellent customer service. Throughout my time at the hotel I also started training other front desk
    agents and writing documents to help with training.

<h2> Wente Boy Scout Reservation </h2>
<p>
    During the summer of 2019 I worked as a Boy Scout Summer Camp Councilor for the Wente Scout Reservation.
    I was a rock climbing instructor and was responsible for safely setting up routes in the morning, managing safety
    equipment, teaching scouts how to climb and belay safely, and helping check in and out troops of scouts each week.
